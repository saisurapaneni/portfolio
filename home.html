              <p>Think of an elastic band, it fits to how much it can stretch. Same with the browser.
                 Lucky us we do not have to do all the calculations to find out the elasticity of the browser.
                CSS (you know what it is) frame work, bootstrap takes care of this. This divides the browser into to 12 column grid
                (like a graph). This gives us power to divide and rule and you get the gist. The term "media queries",
                have you heard that? Yes! it is a query that asks browser and determines the width, the height and lets us
                specify the styles.</p>

							<h3 class="title">Uniqueness is important</h3>
              <p>As a web developer and as a user, uniqueness across browsers is very important.
                   While developing we do not target one browser. We take the top 5 browsers and make sure
                   the look and feel is the same. Chrome, Internet Explorer(IE), Safari, Firefox and so on.
                   It is important to care for IE as this is only browser that a user has access to with out download/installing.

							<h3 class="title">Keep it Clean. Follow standards</h3>
                 <p>Change version of the software of every deployment.Avoid loading heavy sized multimedia on every refresh.
                   Store it in the cache and refresh on aversion change. Minify the styles and scripts.Handle the errors
                   and let user know. Load the resources at the end of the page.</p>
